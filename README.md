# Simple Othello Game (Coffee, Tea or Me?)

Othello is an 8x8 grid game that involves placing down colored disks/seeds on the board to convert other adjacent colored disks/seeds to your own color. The objective of this game is to get the most number of disks/seeds in your color.

## Planning and Development Process

With the concept of designing the Othello game, the logic of placing the disk/seed and flipping the seeds to the correct color will need to be finished. Once that is done, styling and board design is implemented. Finally, the AI portion is done with a simple random move picker.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

From the grid, the need to check each grid adjacent to the placed disk/seed gives rise to a need to write a function that is reusable no matter the position of the disk. The function will also need to check continuously in one direction until there is a change in color for it to be a valid move.

### Unsolved problems

Styling for the flipping of the disk by disk was not able to be completed.
A more sophisticated AI using the min-max method was also not done in this project.
